Question #0
Look at the following code.

You do not have to know exactly what this code does yet (but you will soon!).

Question #1
The following code gives this output. What is the error?

We want to compare j so we need an if statement before j == j - 1


We want to assign j a new value, not compare it, so it should be j = j - 1 instead of j == j - 1 *


We don’t need to assign a new value to j because it doesn’t do anything

Question #2
This code doesn’t work as intended.

#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
                if (i % 2 != 0)
                {
                        continue;
                }
                else
                {
                        break;
                }

                printf("%d\n", i);
        }

        return(0);
}
Let’s add printf statements to the code. What information do the printf statements tell us about how our code is executed?

#include "main.h"

/**
* main - prints even numbers from 0 to 100
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Before loop\n");

        for (i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
                if (i % 2 != 0)
                {
                        printf("i is not even so don't print\n");
                        continue;
                }
                else
                {
                        printf("i is even, break to print\n");
                        break;
                }

                printf("Outside of if/else, still inside for loop\n");

                printf("%d\n", i);
        }

        printf("For loop exited\n");

        return(0);
}

printf statements shows that break will cause “For loop exited” to print, indicating that the even number is never printed *


A printf statement shows that there is an infinite loop in the code


A printf statement shows exactly how many times the loop executes


A printf statement shows when the for loop is finished *

Question #3
The following code gives this incorrect output. Which of the following statements about what is causing the error is true?
